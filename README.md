# cheatsheet1
This is my first cheat sheet project <br>
# Reason
This will give myself a quick resource to referance as I parsed some of the information down from longer lists.
# Problem Solved
I can quickly referance things without always having to google them or keep more tabs open. Specifically display properties that are an area I'm less competent in.
